#   Emulate MediaWiki behavior. We need not worry about `/wiki` (with no
#   trailing slash) because Netlify seems to automatically use this
#   redirect for that, too. (MediaWiki issues a 302 temporary redirect
#   to the one with a trailing slash and then the 301, but this is faster
#   and it's not #   worth trying to emulate MediaWiki on this anyway.)
