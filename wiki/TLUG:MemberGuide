</ul>
<p>Comments or offers to help should be sent to the TLUG webmaster.</p>
<h4 id="meetings">Meetings</h4>
<p>TLUG techincal meetings are held on the second Saturday of every odd month. Demonstrations, talks, and equipment are made available for the membership.</p>
<p>See the <a href="./Current_Meeting">meeting page</a> for details about upcoming meetings.</p>
<h4 id="parties">Parties</h4>
<p>Parties are held on a week night of every even month. The social interaction, beer, and food is an excellent way to create a stronger Linux community spirit.</p>
<p>See the <a href="./Current_Meeting">meeting page</a> for details about upcoming parties.</p>
<h4 id="discounts">Discounts</h4>
<p>TLUG is a member of GLUE and qualifies for discounts on SCC publications, including Linux Journal. WGS also offers TLUG members a discount.</p>
<h4 id="prizes">Prizes</h4>
<p>TLUG negotiates donations from corporations and individuals and distributes software and hardware to the membership. The prizes are usually given out at the meetings as part of a game. TLUG has given out stickers, Linux distributions, Linux Journals, Sparc hardware, PCs, keyboards, T-Shirts, monitors, books, and a lot more.</p>
<h4 id="software_and_book_library">Software and Book Library</h4>
<p>TLUG is creating a library of books and software that can be loaned out to members.</p>
<h2 id="size_of_group">Size of Group</h2>
<p>The size of TLUG is calculated as the combined number of people on the TLUG mailing list and TLUG digest. There are over 240 people actively using the mailing list. The April 11th, 1998 meeting brought together over 65 Linux enthusiasts in Tokyo, including Tague Griffith of Netscape Communication's I18N division and Cliff Miller, the first President of TurboLinux.</p>
<h2 id="structure_of_group">Structure of Group</h2>
<p>TLUG is loosely structured. If you want to volunteer, don't be shy - we can use your help.
A rough organization chart is available at <a href="./TLUG:Organization">TLUG:Organization</a></p>
<h2 id="joining_tlug">Joining TLUG</h2>
<p>If you join the mailing list, you're considered a member. There are no membership dues or fees. Anyone is free to show up for the meetings or parties and to leave at any time. We try to get a listing of attendees prior to the meeting date so we can make reservations, but if someone has free time at the last minute, feel free to drop by. Since the group tries to promote Linux use, it encourages everyone in Tokyo to drop by.</p>
<p>Language hasn't been a problem. Japanese and English have been mixing smoothly. There are pockets of Spanish, Portuguese and Russian. Pictures of the members are available on the member pages, so you can look at the crowd before you venture to a meeting.</p>
<p>If you can't make it to Tokyo, you can still join and participate through electronic mail.</p>
<h3 id="fees">Fees</h3>
<p>Currently there are no membership dues or fees. There are no plans to change this in the foreseeable future.</p>
<h2 id="helping_out">Helping Out</h2>
<p>TLUG is always looking for volunteers for both club administration and for various projects.</p>
<p>Volunteers needed to</p>
<ul>
<li>organize the parties (contact tlug-admin@tlug.jp)</li>
<li>expand membership, solicit corporate donations</li>
<li>establish better balance between number of male and number of female membership by increasing benefits of TLUG membership for females</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, helping out others on the mailing list with technical questions is helping the Linux community in general.</p>
<p>If nothing interests you at the moment, join the mailing list and say something like, “I want to volunteer for something.”</p>
<h2 id="using_tlug_resources">Using TLUG Resources</h2>
<p>The TLUG server currently offers the following lists:<br />
* lingo</p>
<ul>
<li>tlug</li>
<li>tlug-admin</li>
<li>tlug-digest</li>
</ul>
<p>See the TLUG list page for more info on how to subscribe to the lists.</p>
<p>The main tlug list is for technical discussion only. Posts are firmly limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software issues concerning linux/unix operating systems</li>
<li>Software issues concerning tools, programs, etc.</li>
<li>Software issues concerning Open Source Code</li>
<li>Hardware-related issues</li>
<li>Books / Book reviews What is Linux</li>
<li>What is Open Source Code Software?</li>
<li>Why does Open Source Code work?</li>
<li>Jokes, General Conversation (hopefully linux related :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>The tlug-admin list is used to discuss matters relating to the administration of TLUG. As such, the posts concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tlug server issues</li>
<li>Tlug webpages</li>
<li>Tlug mailing Lists</li>
<li>Tlug meetings/Nomikais</li>
<li>Tlug finances</li>
<li>Tlug projects (CDRoms, T-Shirts, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to join the lists.</p>
<p>The Lingo list is for natural language related discussions, such as use of Japanese etc.</p>
<p>Cross-posting between lists is to be restricted to tlug announcments such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>tlug meeting announcements</li>
<li>tlug server announcements</li>
<li>tlug FAQ announcements</li>
</ul>
<p>Replies to these postings should be to only one list, preferably tlug-admin or tlug.</p>
<h3 id="appropriate_material_for_tlug_mailing_lists">Appropriate Material for TLUG Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>It is important for people posting to the TLUG list to be good net.citizens and to remember that they are part of the Linux Community if they choose to be. Experience shows that the following kinds of topics are appropriate and useful on selected TLUG lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux specific technical questions and answers in any language, though English and Japanese are the two major languages.</li>
<li>Really easy Linux questions that you feel embarrassed to ask.</li>
<li>Really techie programming or hardware questions that makes make you feel like a geek when you ask them.</li>
<li>Linux announcements, information, anything Linux-centric you want to share.</li>
<li>Job postings appropriate for Linux users or Job search as long as they are in good taste. (we can vote on this if it becomes an issue. Right now, it appears to be okay, but headhunters seem to be regarded as evil)</li>
<li>Looking to sell, buy, or give away Linux hardware or software.</li>
<li>General Internet, network, TCP/IP, UNIX questions.</li>
<li>General questions about where to buy software, hardware, books, and other techie things in Tokyo or Akihabara.</li>
<li>Anything that you feel is appropriate after you've read a TLUG list for a while. However, please try to keep the majority of posts Linux-centric.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inappropriate_material_for_mailing_lists">Inappropriate Material for Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>“Praise in public; criticize in private.” Some disagreements will inevitably arise, but flames must be sent privately and off-line. If you feel you need to correct factual errors on the list, be polite and correct just the facts. Personal attacks on the author are not tolerated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Random emotional complaints about Linux, or any operating system or software system, used to vent a person's frustration.</li>
<li>Repeated and frequent questions on non-Linux operating systems such as Windows2000, Mac, Novell that have no connection to Linux. The occasional question appears to be okay, but if you get the response `Erm, why aren't you using the Linux version of Swiss Army Knife? It's perfect for that application!' that's only natural. Complaining about the Linux software's lack of features would likely be an inappropriate followup, unless you are proposing to implement them (note: you don't need to volunteer to do the coding!) or requesting a workaround for the missing feature.</li>
<li>Overly large postings or messages will automatically be bounced. If you want to share a large file, place it on the Internet and announce the location of the file.</li>
<li>Any topic that members vote on and don't feel is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="strategies_for_dealing_with_the_mailing_list_volume">Strategies for Dealing With the Mailing List Volume</h3>
<p>TLUG can generate between 5 and 50 postings per day. There are several strategies to deal with the volume of notes.</p>
<h4 id="sort_by_sender">Sort by Sender</h4>
<p>The list mail is sent from owner-tlug@tlug.jp. You can filter the mail using procmail or a similar filter as it comes in. Your MUA (Mail User Agent) may allow you to sort by other fields such as To: or Subject:. Mail sent to TLUG will have 'tlug' in the subject.</p>
<h4 id="subscribe_to_the_tlug_digest">Subscribe to the TLUG Digest</h4>
<p>The digest automatically collects TLUG mailing list messages and puts them into a digest with a table of contents. The digest is sent out once a day or when a maximum size has been reached. The digest and mailing list contain the same information, so a TLUG member may unsubscribe from the mailing list and still participate using the digest.</p>
<h4 id="thread_the_subject_line">Thread the subject line</h4>
<p>Certain mailers such as mutt, xfmail, netscape and I think mew can thread the subject line. A thread is the topic of discussion generated by use of the reply function. If the thread is not interesting, the TLUG member can skip over the thread.</p>
<h2 id="organization_information">Organization Information</h2>
<p>Although TLUG is non-profit, it is not officially registered as an organization. If anyone wants to register TLUG, feel free to volunteer to lead the effort.</p>
<p>TLUG's expenses are met by donations, mainly by companies or members donating computer hardware/software which is auctioned off at technical meetings.</p>
